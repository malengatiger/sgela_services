 Subject: Request for Clarification and Meeting Regarding Recent Subpoena for Debt

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing in response to the subpoena for a debt that I recently received, which I understand was issued on behalf of your client. I would like to acknowledge receipt of the subpoena and express my intention to cooperate in a reasonable and responsible manner throughout this process.

At this point, I have some questions and concerns regarding the debt in question, and I believe that a meeting between us would be beneficial in clarifying several matters. Specifically, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the following:

1. The total amount outstanding, including any interest, fees, or penalties that may have been added.
2. The original creditor and the basis for the claim, including the relevant timeline of events.
3. The specific documents and evidence supporting your client's claim.
4. The options available to me for resolving this debt, including any repayment plans or alternative arrangements that may be considered.

I am eager to work collaboratively to address this matter and aim to find a mutually agreeable solution. I would like to schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience, either in person or via teleconference, to discuss the aforementioned points and any other relevant information.

 If the debt in question is for house rates and taxes that the municipality failed to inform you about for 22 years, you should definitely bring this up in your meeting with the attorney. Here's a suggested way to modify the email draft I provided earlier:

Subject: Acknowledgement of Subpoena and Request for Meeting

Dear [Attorney's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to acknowledge receipt of the subpoena served upon me by your office on [date] regarding the debt owed to [municipality's name] for house rates and taxes. I am open to cooperating fully with the legal process and would like to request a meeting with you to discuss the matter further.

I was shocked to learn of this debt, as I was never informed about it by the municipality for the past 22 years. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to clarify the situation and obtain a better understanding of the amount outstanding. I would also like to discuss the fact that I was not notified of this debt until now, and explore possible next steps.

Would it be possible to schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience? I am available [list specific dates and times that work for you]. Alternatively, I can be reached by phone at [your phone number] if that is more convenient for you.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

It's important to gather any evidence you have that supports your claim that you were not notified of this debt by the municipality, such as old bank statements or correspondence with the municipality. Bring this evidence with you to the meeting with the attorney, as it may help your case. Additionally, you may want to seek legal advice from a consumer protection lawyer or legal aid organization to understand your rights and options in this situation.

 Subject: Dispute Regarding Overdue House Rates and Taxes

Dear [Attorney's Name],

I am writing to address the outstanding debt for house rates and taxes that has recently been brought to my attention. This amount is alleged to have accrued over the past 22 years due to the municipality's failure to communicate this issue to me. Given the age and nature of this debt, I believe it is essential for me to dispute this amount and seek a resolution that is fair and reflects the situation.

Over the past few years, I have made considerable efforts to maintain good standing in the community in terms of property taxes and related matters. Furthermore, I have a clear understanding of the current financial situation and would be willing to provide any necessary documentation to demonstrate this in relation to the outstanding debt.

To facilitate a resolution that is satisfactory for all parties involved, I would like to request a meeting to discuss the details of this debt and the circumstances surrounding your client's failure to notify me of its existence until recently. I understand that the statute of limitations for collecting this debt may be a factor, and I would be interested in exploring options to resolve this amicably outside of any legal technicalities.

Please let me know whether it would be possible to schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience. I am available [list specific dates and times that work for you]. Alternatively, I can be reached by phone at [your phone number] if that is more convenient for you.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am looking forward to addressing and resolving this issue promptly and fairly.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
